#### Info:

 Problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture

 Collatz is a researching tool that simulates 'Collatz's conjecture' math problem on a computacional level.

 It will provide you all maths requirements to see results of desided combinations, applying automatically conjeture rules. 

 This is very useful to simplify human abstraction level.

 There are 3 possible modes for interaction: single random, manual and learning.

    - single random (default): Just a simple random test that will allow you to understand how it works.
    - manual: You can search for results on any number you enter.
    - learning: Your AI will like this feature a lot ;-)

 You can visualize plotting graphs with results, store math 'tree' relationships (so the tool doesn't need to process again similar data) 
 and organized auto-save your results, for example, to be used on a future for BigData processing or AI maths solving tasks.

#### Installing:

 This tool runs on many platforms and it requires Python (3.x.y). To generate graphs, you need to install the following library:

       python3-matplotlib - Python based plotting system in a style similar to Matlab (Python 3)

 On Debian-based systems (ex: Ubuntu), run: 

       sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib

 Or:

       pip3 install matplotlib

#### Executing:
  
  python3 collatz
